# **MedAnal-Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning**

Welcome to MedAnal, an innovative deep learning project that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze chest X-ray images and detect the presence of pneumonia. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more efficiently and accurately.
#About
Pneumonia is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide each year. pneumonia is estimated to account for around 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old, making it one of the leading causes of death in this age group. In older adults and individuals with compromised immune systems, pneumonia can also contribute significantly to mortality rates. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and patient outcomes. MedAnal leverages the power of deep learning to automate the process of pneumonia detection, enabling faster and more reliable diagnosis.
